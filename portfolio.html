You can roll the dice by pressing the roll button or shaking your electronic. Click on the dice to go to mitapinventor.com and see the code!</font></p></center>

	<center><p><font size="+4">The question we had was: What is the demographic of the House of Representatives over the years? We made a graph that illustrated that, and it shows that from 2008-2010, it was a majority of democrats, and from 2012-2018, the house was a majority of republicans until 2020, when the house change and became democratic majority again.</font></p></center>
	<center><p><font size="+4">We got our results from https://history.house.gov/Institution/Party-Divisions/Party-Divisions/. We decided to use a bar graph, because it can represent multiple years and it would allow us to compare the number of democrats vs. republicans in the house easily. This graph was based on a normal bar graph, and we just used code used in a normal bar graph for our bar graph.</font></p></center>

In addition, we increased the chemicals in each patch, and lowered the rate that the bacteria emitted for the bacteria onto other colonies. Thus, the chemicals formed a long conga line across the screen. The first picture is the original while the second picture is the modified.</font></p></center>
